# No Pain No Gain

A tiny app.

## Use case

You or one of your kids wants something really badly (a "gain").  
Add this item to this app and give it a price tag, e.g.:

> New Lego Star Wars: $8

Now every time you do forge an expense, add the saved amount to this app ("pain").

> No ice cream on hot day: + $2

Once your saved amount is higher than the price tag of your desire, redeem it.  
Your saved amount will decrease by this amount.

Challenge yourself how much money you can save in your daily rountine!

##### Examples:

* No daily Starbucks coffee
* No dessert at lunch

* Buy the cheaper menu
* Drink one beer less at the bar
